 ## Hello, and welcome to my profile! 👋

 I am a current university student and coding as a hobby in my spare time. I have some experience in Java, a one year introduction to computer science course's worth of it, but I had a blast learning how to code and I decided to branch out and learn more after that!

 ### What I want to get out of coding📎
I really enjoy making small apps and scripts that improve my day-to-day life, but I'm really looking to increase my knowledge and skillset in Python to build more robust apps and programs. I also want to be of help to others in the open source community, and help out wherever I can!

 ### My goals📝
 I'm currently aspiring to make a very simple programming language of my own based on a Python compiler that I write. I want it to be able to handle basic sytax and function calls, and maybe even implement objects and classes at some point. I really want to dig into what makes programming languages work so that I can have a better understanding of languages that do currently exist!

 ### My setup 🖥️
 VSCode, GitHub Desktop, and an intermediate level of Python knowledge!
